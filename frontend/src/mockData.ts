    detailedDescription: `## Aria - Generative AI for MIDI Music

Aria is a state-of-the-art generative AI system designed for symbolic music composition, powered by the Anticipatory Music Transformer from Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University.

### Core Technology
- **Base Model**: Anticipatory Music Transformer by John Thickstun, David Hall, Percy Liang (Stanford) and Chris Donahue (CMU)
- **Training Data**: Fine-tuned on 50,000+ MIDI transcriptions of popular songs across all genres
- **Specialization**: Fluent in harmonic structures and melodic patterns from the corpus of popular music

### Key Capabilities
- **Continuation Generation**: Creates natural left-to-right continuations of existing MIDI tracks
- **Contextual Awareness**: Analyzes surrounding musical context to generate fitting continuations
- **Genre Versatility**: Trained on diverse musical styles from jazz to electronic to classical
- **Symbolic Music Focus**: Specialized for MIDI/symbolic music rather than audio generation

### How It Works
1. Analyzes the input MIDI track for harmonic and melodic patterns
2. Uses transformer architecture to predict musically coherent continuations
3. Applies learned patterns from 50,000+ song database
4. Generates contextually appropriate MIDI continuation

Perfect for composers seeking AI-assisted inspiration, breaking creative blocks, or exploring new musical directions. Developed in partnership with HookTheory and integrated into professional music composition workflows.

Aria encountered an error while processing a multi-track MIDI file due to input format constraints.

### Error Analysis
The input MIDI file contained 8 separate tracks (piano, bass, drums, strings, etc.) but Aria is designed to process single melodic tracks for continuation generation.

### Input Specifications
- **File**: full_arrangement_8tracks.mid
- **Problem**: Multi-track arrangement with complex orchestration
- **Expected Format**: Single melodic track (MidiTrack type)

### Resolution Required
Extract the main melodic line into a separate single-track MIDI file, or use a different workflow designed for full arrangement processing.

### Technical Details
Aria's Anticipatory Music Transformer is optimized for symbolic melody continuation rather than full multi-track orchestration. For best results, provide isolated melodic content."""`,
